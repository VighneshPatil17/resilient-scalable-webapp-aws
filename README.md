A **Resilient and Scalable Web Application Deployment** on AWS using industry-standard practices.  
This project demonstrates how to design, containerize, and deploy a production-ready application with high availability, fault tolerance, and automation in mind.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this capstone project is to:
- Build and deploy a web application on AWS.  
- Use **Docker containers** for portability.  
- Leverage **Nginx reverse proxy** for routing requests.  
- Ensure **scalability & resilience** via AWS cloud infrastructure.  
- Document the full deployment pipeline in a way that recruiters and engineers can follow.  

This repository represents **end-to-end DevOps skills**, including system design, containerization, and deployment.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
The system is designed as follows:
- **Frontend & Backend services** packaged as Docker containers.  
- **Nginx reverse proxy** routes requests to respective services.  
- **AWS infrastructure** hosts the services for scalability and resilience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-capstone-project-1.git
cd aws-capstone-project-1

### 2. Build & Run with Docker Compose
    docker-compose up --build

🧪 Testing the Deployment
Once the containers are up:
Visit the /service1 and /service2 endpoints in your browser.
Use curl or Postman to test responses:
  curl http://localhost/service1
  curl http://localhost/service2

🌟 Key Highlights

✅ Now this is **full code**, no outside text, everything in one clean `README.md`.  
Do you also want me to add a **“What recruiters should notice” section** at the top (like a career branding pitch), or keep it 100% technical?
